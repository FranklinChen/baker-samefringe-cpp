# C++ implementation of Henry Baker's same-fringe code

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/baker-samefringe-cpp.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/baker-samefringe-cpp)

Until C++17 comes along with a standard way of encoding algebraic data types as tagged unions, I'm using Boost's [variant](http://theboostcpplibraries.com/boost.variant).

Currently only tested on Mac OS X with clang.
